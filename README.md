# Welcome to my Game Review Site Repo!
This project was the result of a final project proposal in my Server-Side Web Development class. 
We had to utilize all the topics we had learned over the semester to create a website that would convey
our learning of Python and the Django framework, and I decided I wanted to fill a personal need that I have, 
which was to have a website to host my game reviews!

### Features
- Styling with Bootstrap (this wasn't really a front-end class so the styling is basic)
- Visitors can register a new account and use that account to login with built-in user authentication.
- Registered users can see their profile details once they have logged in.
- Reviews are listed on the home page with the game title, my given rating, a short description, and a details button.
- Details button takes users to a page specific to that game review. An embedded video is included for ease of use.
- Included a link to purchase the game on Steam below the embedded video on details page.
